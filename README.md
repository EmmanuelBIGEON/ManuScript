# ManuScript
SystemTray Application for quick launch operations and commands on Windows.
Use CustomTkinter : https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter

You can create commands (name, value)
For now there are only two options : 
- ExternalConsole : Open the terminal and execute the command in it.
- Persistent : Make the terminal persistent after the command ended (if checked, ExternalConsole is automatically true)

When you close the windows, it put the application in the System Tray icons. From here you can still Open the window and execute any command you created.

The commands are saved in a file named commands.json auto-generated.

## Run

```
Install the dependencies : customtkinter, pystray

$ python main.py
```

## Create an executable 

I use PyInstaller, you can install it using : 

$ pip install -U pyinstaller

Open a terminal in the repository location and run this command.

$ pyinstaller -n "ManuScript" -i "favicon.ico" -w main.py

Once you're done, copy the "favicon.ico" in the dist/main folder because the executable requires it.
Now you can run the executable "ManuScript.exe" and create a shortcut.
